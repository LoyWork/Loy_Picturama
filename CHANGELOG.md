Changelog
=========

v2.0.1 - 2026-10-15
-------------------

  - Move zoom, crop, favorites and trash controls below the photo; keep rotations in the top bar.
  - Replace the zoom slider with a native control spanning 25% to 400% of the fitted image size.
  - Fix zoom rendering for large images and allow small images to zoom beyond the previous 200% limit.
  - Add a save button with completion and retry feedback to the color adjustment panel.
  - Persist exposure, white balance and all other develop settings in per-image `.picturama.yml` sidecars.
    Unedited images create no sidecar, and resetting all edits removes the sidecar. Read legacy directory settings.
  - Show every image-bearing folder and its ancestors in an expandable tree, with full-path filtering.
  - Add a folder context menu containing only the command to open that directory in Windows Explorer.
  - Make the folder sidebar resizable, remember its width, and support double-click to restore the default.
